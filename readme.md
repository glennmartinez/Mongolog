# MongoLog

This is a simple project building a simple weblog using MongoDb, Sinatra
and Mustache.

Also I am using the latest beta of Sass, Compass and Susy for styling.

## Why

This is not for production use or any on going open source project.
This is simply to learn a little about MongoDb and Mustache.

## Why Mustache?

Hey Tom? What is mustache and why are you not using Haml?

First off HAML Rocks!  It is awesome to write and maintain, but I wanted
to dive into Mustache, and the main reason is to build logic and
language agnostic markup.

My original plan was to build a blog using MongoDb, Sinatra, Mustache,
Zepto, Backbone, and CoffeeScript.  But when I went to implement I
clearly was doing more than I could handle, so I decided to take a step
back and implement Mustache server side.  My goal is to then refactor
and implement the client side in the next couple of weeks.
